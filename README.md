this is one of the hands on app from John Smilga React course

the implementation of the nice cart function which you might see on a EC site

Purpose for it
I have been learning React for last 3 months. I am getting used to it more with global context using hooks. now I would like to learn Redux to brush up my knowledge, which I think might help me to understand hooks even better.

New awareness
Redux, it is simpler and neater than I thought When I first tried Redux 3 months ago. it was a pretty complicating experience for me to understand then. However, I found it pretty nice and neat this time. this is because I understand React better than before, that's definitely one of the factors (It might be a faster way to make a success of learing Redux if you learn hooks and get used to it first before get into Redux), and also it is just a small application. even based on that, I might like to have Redux in a development . It might be easier to get a picture of an application in a development process. I will build some more applications with Redux, some bigger apps, and will see how..
