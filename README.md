this is one of the hands on app from John Smilga React course on Udemy - 
the implementation of the nice cart function which you might see on a EC site

###### Purpose for it
I have been learning React for last 3 months. I have got used to it with global context using hooks. now I would like to learn Redux to brush up my React knowledge. at the same time, I think it might help me to understand hooks even better.

###### New awareness
Redux, it is simpler and neater than I thought. When I first tried Redux 3 months ago, it was a pretty complicating experience for me to understand. However, I found it pretty nice and neat for this time. this is because I understand React better than before, that's definitely one of the factors (I feel that it might be a faster way to make a success of learing Redux by learning hooks and get used to it first before get into Redux). also it is just a small application which made me feel not confused. even based on that, I might like to have Redux in a development . It might be easier to get a picture of an application in a development process. I will build some more applications with Redux, some bigger apps, and will see how..
